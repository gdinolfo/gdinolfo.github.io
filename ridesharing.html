    <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Project Overview:&nbsp; </strong>This
      project was analysis of a fictitious ride-sharing company, named “Pyber”.
      I used Pandas and NumPy to analyze the data in a Jupyter notebook with
      Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create visualizations to illustrate my
      findings.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Approach:&nbsp; </strong>Data
      was provided as a CSV file that I read into a Pandas data frame for easier
      evaluating and from there I sorted and grouped and ran basic functions to
      determine the number of rides, number of drivers and average fare for each
      type of city (urban, rural, city). From that data I created a bubble chart
      comparing the number of rides to the average fare price and number of
      drivers in each type of city as well as pie charts illustrating each of
      the previous variables individually by city type.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Conclusions:&nbsp; </strong>Rural
      Areas had less drivers and riders, but no well defined trend in
      relationship to average fare. This could possibly be explained by
      population density of rural areas versus urban areas. Drivers in rural
      areas only make up 2.6% of the total drivers while rural areas account for
      approximately 6% of total fares and rides. We also see data points for
      rural average fare well above what is experienced in the city probably due
      to a higher average distance between points of interest in rural areas.
      The number of drivers seems to increase with city classification with
      rural areas having the least amount of drivers per city and urban areas
      having more. There are, however, data points for urban areas that have
      similar number of drivers. There seems to be a negative relationship
      between the number of rides and the average fare. This is more well
      defined for the suburban and urban city classifications. This might the
      average distance a rider is traveling in these cities. Average travel
      distance would be a good dataset to analyze further. However, cities make
      up for 63% and 68% of total fare and rides respectively, but the number of
      drivers in the city is 86.2% of the total drivers. It is possible that
      there is an over supply of drivers in these cities causing lower prices. A
      similar, but less dramatic trend is seen with suburban areas. It would be
      beneficial to see the data on surge pricing to see how the supply of
      drivers effects average fare.</p>
